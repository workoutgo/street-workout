<p>Also, why did planet fitness charge me $40? 24 hour fitness sells these ear buds for $20.00 on up and i later went to walmart and bought a set for $10.00 that go over my ear and stay on the top of my ear and have had no problem with the ones from walmart that cost half as much. Also, do not fret about not having a contract. This lowers the initiation fees to just $29.99 leaving with just a monthly fee $41.99, leaving you with only $113.97 to pay when signing up.
