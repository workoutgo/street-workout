Newburyport, MA Fitness From planetfitness.com
I&#39;m new to planet fitness and my club recently opened. You can transfer your membership online with just a few clicks, starting here (you’ll need your planet fitness keytag number). (9 days ago) yes, with a black card membership you have what is called reciprocal access, which means that you can go use any planet fitness anywhere. Nonetheless i hope to find a planet fitness barbershop soon or at least i hope they bring them to florida.
