<p>As you can tell by the name, there are no plyometric exercises in this dvd, which i think is one of the best things about the insanity series. This workout program is not for the faint of heart. I had to take a few 2 second breaks when you weren't supposed to, but all in all its about 20 mins of stretching and light cardio, then 20 minutes of intermediate cardio. I threw in 15 extra minutes on the elliptical after because i wasn't tired. Pin by Gina Brown on Motivational pics Insanity workout results.</p>
