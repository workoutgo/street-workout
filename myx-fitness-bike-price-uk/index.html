The old saying “you get what you pay for” is accurate, and the same goes for both bikes. Openfit memberships will be available to new myx ii and myx ii plus at the same competitive $29 per month offered currently by myx. Priced within roughly $100 of each other ($1,199 for myx, and $1,039 for echelon, not including delivery), the bikes take two very different paths at solving a similar problem. Your $39 (total!) monthly myx membership gives up to 5 people access to the widest range of workouts available, on and off the bike.
