The minimal essential strain is the minimum about of stress to the bone necessary for bone growth to begin. It’s named so because the purpose is to prepare the foundation for harder training that lies ahead. Based on the athlete experience and athletic performance, an anatomical adaptation phase should last between four to eight weeks (or more for a novice). The overload principle is responsible for the improvement in.
