What are the cause of elevated creatine kinase (CK)? From umqaa.com
Few people are aware that exercise, especially intense activity, can significantly alter certain laboratory tests. After triathalons, athletes may have cpk elevations of greater than 20,000 iu/l without any renal compromise [2]. Exercises that involve weightlifting and downhill running cause higher increase in cpk levels. Cpk levels are seen to increase after a strenuous exercise.
