Fitness 30 Minute Workouts YouTube From youtube.com
What a terrible job to have, hard work is. The brand of the machines is life fitness, and i found a life fitness connect app on the google play store but it would not connect to the machines. Planet fitness has hundreds of workout videos and tutorials to keep you moving at home. I find it difficult to do my regular workout which is barbell centric, but i do get a decent workout there.
