The Veteran Marathoner Training Plan | Gabinetecivil-Alshops From gabinetecivil.al.gov.br
Basic level 1500 meter, 1600 meter and mile preseason training week 1 After another rest of three to five minutes, finish the workout with four repeats of 400 m at an even faster pace. The mileage for the 1500/1600 runner should be about 45 minutes to an hour on easy days and up to maybe an hour and a half on. Because the skill level varies so much in middle distance runners, the target times for each 600 meter repeat must also be varied based on table 1.
