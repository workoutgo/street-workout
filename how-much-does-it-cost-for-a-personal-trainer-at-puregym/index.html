24 Hour Gyms in Salisbury from £19.99 PureGym From puregym.com
You have to work 3 4 hour shifts throughout the week where all you do is clean the gym and do classes. It’s now the uk’s largest gym operator by both number of gyms and members, boasting over 270 gyms with 1 million members. Also if you aren’t booked, you don’t get payed. Absolutely 100% worth the money for me when the trainer is a good one.
