From venturebeat.com

But for most, the high price — starting at $185 per month for access to a single location and topping out at $500 per month for the premier experience — acts as a gilded gate that keeps those outside wondering what resplendent luxuries lie inside. If you decide you want to add it on at a later time, it will be $15 per month, per child.
