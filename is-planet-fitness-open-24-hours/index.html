<p>(6 days ago) 24 hour fitness hours are 7 days a week, and 24 hours a day with exemption of thanksgiving, christmas and new yearâs. Planet fitness is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. However, i would double check your local branch to make sure their hours work for you. The locker room is still the same, but, it seems cleaner, i think they changed cleaning services.</p>
