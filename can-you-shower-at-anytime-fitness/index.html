Does anytime fitness have showers? Keep in mind, you do not have to work out if you just want to go in and grab a shower. There&#39;s always a couple of standalone shower rooms (privacy!) though the quality varies and with a heck of a lot more locations than pf. It must vary location to location, i am a member and have seen 5 locations ranging from awesome modern cardio equipment good free weights, machines and private shower/changing rooms, to broken worn out equipment with a few pink dumbells and moldy shower/locker rooms.
