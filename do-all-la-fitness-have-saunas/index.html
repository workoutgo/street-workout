<p>Love using the sauna at la fitness but found itâs not always the same temp at different gyms. In terms of chain gyms, la can easily be considered the rolls royce, as they attempt to have bigger, brighter gyms with more amenities than the other chain gyms, with many locations having full basketball courts and olympic sized. La fitness has become one of the biggest gym chains in the country, and it seems like new locations are popping up all of the time. Making healthy happen should be as easy as possible and the option to take a quick shower after a workout is sometimes the difference between âi can work outâ and âi canât work out.â while all clubs have showers and bathrooms, not all locations offer lockers.
