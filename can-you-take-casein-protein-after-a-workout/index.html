Still, if you really want to stick to a schedule, you may consider taking casein protein at the following times. If you’re into strenuous workouts, bodybuilding, weightlifting or work in the dairy industry, you’re probably familiar with casein protein powder. Because whey protein contains about 26% more leucine than casein, it may be more effective at stimulating muscle growth — both at rest and after a workout (17, 18, 19, 20). This helps provide your muscles with instant nutrition required for quick recovery and growth.
